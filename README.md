# Financial Dashboard
## Project Summary
This project follows the real-world process of receiving a business problem from management, consolidating and visualizing data relating to the problem, and preparing a solution based on key metrics. The problem being, should there be a price increase the following year? If so, by how much?

Using SQL server, I cleaned and organized fiscal data over two years for a bike sharing business. Then I created a dashboard that displays the seasonality of data and information related to the customer base (visualizations important to understand where the revenue is coming from and the general profit trend over the two years). Finally, I compared the price change, demand, revenues, and profits between the two years to suggest a price increase and measures that the company should take going forward.

## Motivation and Goal
Itâ€™s important to efficiently and clearly display data that is relevant to any given business problem, as it helps others easily understand how a potential solution was reached. My goal is to work through the process using data visualization software and SQL.

## Tools and Datasets
### Tools:
- SQL Server
- SQL Server Management System
- Power BI

### Dataset:
Bike Sharing Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/bike-sharing-dataset/data

## Limitations ad Next Steps
Optimal price predictions could be further explored through regression and ML techniques (more historical data would be useful for this approach).
I could also expand my dashboard or create multiple dashboards to showcase more detailed metrics.
